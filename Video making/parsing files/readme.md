The parsing files are made so you dont have to spend time helping the code understand your .tsv
i am still working on this and will make it more extensive and less sophisticatated

# how to use

1. copypaste these files into processing (java wrapper)
2. name the second file person
3. save the files into a folder with your dataset
4. start coding!



abacaba on youtube has a video that taught me how to parse , you should check him out!
